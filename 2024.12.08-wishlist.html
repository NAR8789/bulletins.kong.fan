No individual gifts please. This year we'd like to pool resources towards a backyard swingset we can all share on future playdates.  If you like this idea, $5 or $10 would be plenty, and Amazon gift card would be the most convenient. Contribution is optional. Your presence and connection are the best gifts we could ask for on this special day.
